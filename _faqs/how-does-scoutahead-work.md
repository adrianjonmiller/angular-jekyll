title: How does Scoutahead™ work?
---

Scoutahead™ provides you with confidential feedback from those you trust to move ahead in the workplace. It works in three steps. First, you fill out a self-evaluation about your personality and, if you've been in the workforce, your job skills. We will provide you some initial feedback about how you see yourself. Second, you will ask people you know to fill out the same evaluation of you. Third, once enough people have evaluated you, we provide you composite feedback from your peers for each of the same traits and skills that were included in your self-evaluation results.
