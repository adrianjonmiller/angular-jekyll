title: 'If I review my colleague, will they be able to see what I said?'

No. We never share individual reviews with anyone, even the person being reviewed. We anonymize and aggregate reviews to protect other users' privacy and to encourage honest feedback.

Consider an example involving four people: Alex, Barry, Christine, and David.

Let’s say Alex, Barry, and Christine all review David.

David will never see what any individual person said about him. David can’t see what Alex said, nor can he see what Barry or Christine said. Instead, David will see composite scores based on a weighted combination of the reviews from Alex, Barry, and Christine.
