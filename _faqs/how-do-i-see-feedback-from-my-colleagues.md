title: How do I see feedback from my colleagues?
order: 8

Once you have received three reviews from your colleagues, and you have reviewed at least three colleagues, we provide you with the opportunity to see your "Scores." This lets you see how all of your colleagues collectively have reviewed you using the same criteria that you used in your self-evaluation. You will never see how another user individually rated you in any area. We anonymize and aggregate reviews to protect other users' privacy and to encourage honest feedback.
