title: Why do I have to complete reviews of three other people before I can see feedback about me?

Scoutahead requires all of its users to complete a minimum of three reviews of their colleagues in order to get feedback about themselves. For Scoutahead to work best, users must review one another. We ask that users review their colleagues in exchange for being reviewed themselves.
