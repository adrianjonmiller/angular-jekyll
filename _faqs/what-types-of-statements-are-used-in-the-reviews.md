title: What types of statements are used in the reviews?
---

We use two kinds of statements: General and job-specific.

The general statements have been prepared by workplace and psychology experts. These relate to attitudes, preferences, and behaviors that are personally and interpersonally relevant to the workplace. All users will rate themselves and their colleagues on these statements.

The job-specific statements are related to your skills in your listed occupation. The Scoutahead job-specific statements will be redrafted by peer-elected experts in each field in the coming months. Additionally, future specialization will allow for even more detailed statements to be added.
