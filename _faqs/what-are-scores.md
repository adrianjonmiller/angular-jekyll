title: What are scores?
order: 12
---

Scoutahead provides you with feedback using scores based on your self-evaluation as well as from peer reviews. This includes numeric and descriptive information about how you see yourself and how you are perceived by others in different categories of traits and skills. The scores are composite category ratings provided from different groupings of related statements. Your self-evaluation scores are available immediately. You will see scores based on peer reviews only after three people have reviewed you and you have rated three colleagues. You will never see how another user individually rated you, for either a category or a specific statement. We anonymize and aggregate reviews to protect other users' privacy and to encourage honest feedback.
