        <h4 class="text--heading">What Kind of Information Does Scoutahead Collect About Me?</h4>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Account Information</em>
        .<em> </em>We collect information about you when you interact with our site. We collect information you provide to us including, but not limited to, your
        name, physical address, e-mail address, phone number, gender, photos, and professional information, including your resume, provided to complete your
        profile. Subject to the settings you choose, certain profile information is visible to other users and through publicly-accessible search.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Assessment Information</em>
        .<em> </em>We collect assessments, ratings, or other forms of evaluation provided by our users, including you (collectively, “Assessments”). These include
        the following types of Assessment:
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Self-Assessment</em>
        . Assessment you make of yourself (“Self-Assessment”).
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Your Assessment of Others.</em>
        Assessment you make of others, including other individual people, as well as companies, schools, and other entities (each considered “Your Assessment of
        Another User”), and
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Other User’s Assessment of You. </em>
        Assessment that another user makes about you (“Other User’s Assessment of You”).
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Connections</em>
        .<em> </em>We also collect information about the people and groups (such as schools or employers) you are connected to, including information you provide
        about them and information that they provide about you. We also collect contact information you provide if you upload, sync, or import this information
        (such as an address book or contact list) from a device or an online service.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Usage</em>
        .<em> </em>We may collect information about the devices you use to interact with our Services. This includes things such as your web browser type and

    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Location Information</em>
        . We do not track your movements, but for your convenience we may collect location information from you to facilitate use of our Services. For example,
        when you want to fill out information about what city you work in, it may be easier to use a pre-populated location information. We may collect location
        information through your IP address, geolocation services provided by a device (e.g., through a mobile web browser) you are using, or similar means.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Cookies.</em>
        Scoutahead may place pieces of code, commonly referred to as “cookies,” or similar technology on your devices. We may begin collecting information as soon
        as you visit our site. By using our site, you permit us to collect and use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Many Internet browsers
        and mobile devices allow you to block the transmission of certain information or to block the installation of cookies. You may choose to enable these
        options. However, enabling these options may prevent you from using many of the core features and functions available on our site.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 class="text--heading">How Does Scoutahead Use My Information?</h4>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>For you. </em>
        Scoutahead may use the information we collected about you for a number of purposes related to providing and improving your experience with the Services.
        These purposes include: helping you understand how you and others perceive your job skills; connecting you with potential jobs; helping you evaluate your
        skills; and providing you information about businesses and services that may be of interest to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>For other users.</em>
        Scoutahead may use the information we collected about you to facilitate Other User’s Assessment of You and to connect you with potential jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>For us</em>
        : We use your information to ensure compliance with our policies, offer our Services, and to improve the functioning of our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 class="text--heading">What Types of Information May Scoutahead Share?</h4>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Public Profile Information. </em>
        You will have a public profile on Scoutahead that contains information such as your name, education history, and work history (“Public Profile
        Information”). Public Profile Information will be accessible to other users and the public via search. This facilitates connecting you with people you
        know. In addition, Scoutahead may offer functionality that allows you to create and share content you create with other users. Scoutahead may offer
        functionality to limit certain sharing of Public Profile Information.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Non-Public Profile Information. </em>
        Information that is available to you, but not other users (including employers and schools) is considered “Non-Public Profile Information.” Non-Public
        Profile information includes Self-Assessments, Other User’s Assessments of You, ratings, scores, or any other evaluation information. When you create Your
        Assessment(s) of Others, Your Assessment(s) of Others will be combined with Assessments of that same user made by others in the form of a single composite
        Assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Resume Information</em>
        . When you are a job candidate, we may provide employers with “Resume Information.” That may consist of your resume, and information derived from your
        Public Profile Information (including, but not limited to, skills, work history, and education that you provide to us) that we believe will facilitate
        matching you with interested employers (collectively, “Resume Information”).
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4 class="text--heading">With Whom May Scoutahead Share My Information?</h4>

        share your Non-Public Profile information with potential employers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>With Other Scoutahead Users</em>
        . We may share your Public Profile Information with other users. We will also share Your Assessment(s) of Others as part of a composite set of ratings made
        by multiple users. We do not share your Non-Public Profile Information with other Scoutahead Users.

        hosting services. We may also need to provide a third party provider access to some of your information to support auditing, compliance, and corporate
        governance functions. These third parties have no independent rights in your information and cannot use it for anything except on behalf of Scoutahead.
