  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 21, 2016.</p>

  <p>Scoutahead for Enterprise allows users to communicate, share information, and increase productivity at work. In this Privacy Policy, we describe how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our Scoutahead Enterprise platform, including our website, software, and related services that link to this Privacy Policy ("Services" or "Site") . This Privacy Policy applies only to Scoutahead for "Enterprise User Accounts," which are intended for use by and the benefit of organizations. Scoutahead for Enterprise is a different service than Scoutahead's other services, and those services are governed by their own policies.</p>

  <p>The Services are intended for use by and benefit of organizations. If you are using the Services in a workplace or with an account issued to you by your employer or another organization ("Organization"), that Organization likely has its own data policies that govern storage, access, modification, retention, and deletion of the information you provide through the Services.</p>

  <p><strong>Your Organization can access and process data you submit or provide through the Services. Your Organization also has the right to control and administer your Scoutahead Enterprise User Account. Any questions regarding your Organization's rights with respect to your account should be directed to your Organization.</strong></p>

  <p>Your Scoutahead Enterprise user account ("Your Account" or "Your Scoutahead Enterprise User Account") may be provisioned to you by your organization ("Organization") or directly by Scoutahead.</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our Services, and covers only information collected from you in connection with your access and use of our Services. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>

  <p><strong>What Kind of Information Does Scoutahead Collect?</strong></p>

  <p>Scoutahead collects the following types of information when you, your colleagues, other users, and your Organization access the Services. This includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Information provided directly.</em> In order to provide the Services, we collect information directly from you, your colleagues, or your Organization, including:
      <ul>
        <li><em>Account Information.</em> Account information includes contact information, such as your name and email address, username and password, work title, department, manager, and other work information related to your work and/or your Organization; physical address, phone number, gender, photos, occupational and educational information provided to complete your profile.</li>

        <li><em>Content.</em> All content that you create, including any messages you send, posts you create, audio/video content you send to others, and files you share, or which are provided on your behalf. Information about the content (metadata) is also collected, such as time that particular content was created, and where that content was created.</li>

        <li><em>Connections.</em> We also collect information about the people and groups (such as employee groups within your Organization) you are connected to, including information you provide about them and information that they provide about you. We also collect contact information you provide if you upload, sync, or import this information (such as an address book or contact list) from a device or an online service.</li>

        <li><em>Survey Responses.</em> We collect your responses to surveys in order to provide aggregated results (from all respondents) to the survey.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Automatically Collected Information:</em>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Usage.</em> We may collect information about the devices you use to interact with our Services. This includes things such as your web browser type and version, IP address, information you access, the date and time of usage, language, and browsing information collected through cookies and beacons. We may also automatically collect information about how you use our site, such as what you have searched for and viewed with our site.</li>

        <li><em>Location Information.</em> We do not track your movements, but for your convenience we may collect location information from you to facilitate use of our Services. For example, when you want to fill out information about what city you work in, it may be easier to use pre-populated location information. We may collect location information through your IP address, geolocation services provided by a device (e.g., through a mobile web browser) you are using, or similar means.</li>

        <li><em>Cookies.</em> Scoutahead may place pieces of code, commonly referred to as "cookies," pixel tags, or similar technology on your devices. We may begin collecting information as soon as you visit our site. By using our site, you permit us to collect and use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Many Internet browsers and mobile devices allow you to block the transmission of certain information or to block the installation of cookies. You may choose to enable these options. However, enabling these options may prevent you from using many of the core features and functions available on our site.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>How Does Scoutahead Use My Information?</strong></p>

    <p><em>For you and your Organization.</em> Scoutahead may use the information we collected about you for a number of purposes related to providing and improving your experience with the Services. These purposes include: communicating with other users of the Services; enhancing the security of the Services for you, your Organization, and other users within your Organization; and to personalize your and your Organization's experiences with the Services.</p>

    <p><em>For us:</em> We use your information to develop new tools, products, and services for you and your Organization; ensure compliance with our policies; to offer our Services; and to improve the functioning of our Services. We also may conduct data and system analytics, including research to improve the Services. In the course of such research, however, we shall not examine the contents of messages sent from you to anyone in your Organization using our messaging features.</p>

  <p><strong>Under what circumstances will Scoutahead disclose information?</strong></p>

    <p>In accordance with our agreement with your Organization, you authorize us to disclose information that we collect as follows:</p>

    <ul class="list-blank">
      <li><em>With Your Organization and Related Third Parties.</em> We may disclose information to your Organization, network administrators, and other users authorized by your Organization to access the requested information; to third-party apps, websites, or other services that you or your organization connect to the Services.</li>
      <li><em>With Others Working for Scoutahead.</em> We may need to give some access to your information to third party service providers who perform technical services and functions that are in the United States or in other countries where such service providers assist in providing the Service. For example, a web hosting service provider. We may also need to provide a third party provider access to some of your information to support auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions. These third parties have no independent rights in your information and cannot use it for anything except on behalf of Scoutahead.</li>
      <li><em>With Scoutahead entities.</em> We may disclose information to companies under common control as Scoutahead. We may also disclose information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our Services, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy or insolvency.</li>
      <li><em>Inclusion in Statistics.</em> Scoutahead may also provide information that has been aggregated and that does not personally identify you or your Organization to third parties and affiliates who may use it for analytics, discerning usage patterns and statistics about our Services, to improve the Services, and to provide the Services.</li>
      <li><em>Law and Order.</em> If we receive a subpoena, warrant, discovery, or other request or order from a law enforcement agency, court, governmental entity, or litigant seeking data from your Enterprise User Account, we will attempt to direct the requesting party to seek that information directly you're your Organization. We will provide the requesting party your Organization's contact information. If we are legally compelled to produce information and unless legally prohibited, we will use reasonable efforts to notify your Organization so that they can notify you pursuant to your Organization's policies and as permitted by law. We will direct requests under data protection laws to your Organization, unless prohibited by law.</li>
      <li><em>Security.</em> Scoutahead may share your information with third parties, including law enforcement authorities, where we determine that doing so is appropriate to:
        <ul>
          <li>Enforce our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms of Service;</li>
          <li>Protect our property, services and legal rights;</li>
          <li>Prevent physical harm to the persons or property of others;</li>
          <li>Prevent fraud against us and others;</li>
          <li>Comply with the law.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>As directed by your Organization.</em> We will disclose information as directed by your Organization.</li>
    </ul>

  <p><strong>If I respond to a survey on Scoutahead for Enterprise, what information do you share about my response?</strong></p>

    <p>We want to protect your ability to confidently answer surveys. We won't treat your responses with a different level of protection on Scoutahead for Enterprise than we offer on Scoutahead's other products. We believe it's important that your responses are protected. We do not disclose your responses to anyone on our platform. In order to protect you, we at Scoutahead become the legal owners of survey responses, and we provide only aggregate responses to the survey's creator and your Organization. While we can never guarantee that we will not be compelled to provide your responses (for example, by court order), we believe our framework for handling survey responses is highly protective of employee privacy and anonymity. In the event we are compelled to produce survey responses, we will (if legally practicable) attempt to notify you (using your registered email address) prior to producing those responses.</p>

    <p>Organization accounts have special options to facilitate creation and management of surveys and results among employees within a company (e.g., if the survey creator leaves a company, the results can still be accessed; or if the survey creator so chooses, a survey may be deleted and your access to it is removed). But we do not provide any option for an Organization to see individual responses to a survey.</p>

  <p><strong>Are my chats or messages shared with my employer?</strong></p>

    <p>The messaging, chat, file sharing, or other collaborative features in Scoutahead for Enterprise are similar for privacy purposes to workplace email. Your employer's policies govern access to this data.</p>

  <p><strong>How do account closures work?</strong></p>

    <p>We maintain your Enterprise User Account on behalf of your Organization. If you would like to stop using your Enterprise User Account, contact your Organization. In addition, your Organization may close your Enterprise User Account for any reason, including when you stop working for the Organization.</p>

    <p>When your Enterprise User Account is closed, it is deleted from Scoutahead, except where your Organization directs otherwise. Content you create and share on your Enterprise User Account is owned by your Organization and may remain on Scoutahead for Enterprise even if your Organization suspends or closes your Account. Content you create on Scoutahead is similar to other business records (e.g. memos you create, emails you send) and is governed by your Organization's retention choices. The exception to this policy relates to those features where we take ownership of your content (e.g., your survey responses) and do not intend for your Organization to access that content directly.</p>

  <p><strong>What is my relationship with Scoutahead for purposes of this Enterprise Privacy Policy?</strong></p>

    <p>If your Organization makes Scoutahead for Enterprise Services available to you, then you shall belong to your Organization's Scoutahead Enterprise network ("Organization's Enterprise Network"). In an Organization's Enterprise Network, we provide the Services to your Organization and your Organization controls your Scoutahead Enterprise User Account. Your Organization is responsible for obtaining your consent to data processing carried out on Scoutahead for Enterprise and you should refer to your Organization's internal policies for details on how your Organization manages and controls data associated with Your Account.</p>

    <p>Except as described below, Your Organization controls the information you submit or provide through Scoutahead for Enterprise and owns all of that information along with any other information about you that is submitted or provided by or through your Organization via Scoutahead for Enterprise.</p>

    <p>Exception for Content Submitted With Privacy Protections. When you provide responses to surveys, provide peer reviews, or otherwise give provide input through a function where your input is be kept anonymous from the recipient or your Organization ("Protected Content") Scoutahead becomes owner of your input in order to protect it. Neither your Organization, nor any member of your Organization, shall have ownership or control over Protected Content.</p>

    <p>Personal Accounts. In addition to the Scoutahead for Enterprise Services, you may take advantage of Scoutahead's non-enterprise services. If you provide your personal email address to Scoutahead, or otherwise setup a personal account (registering without your Organization's credentials, for example by providing a personal email address) that account is governed by the standard Scoutahead Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p><strong>Does Scoutahead Track My Activity On Other Sites?</strong></p>

    <p>Except where Scoutahead provides its Services directly in conjunction with a third-party service and where we need to track your activity with respect to such a service, Scoutahead does not collect personal information about your online activities over time across third-party websites or online services. Therefore, "do not track" signals transmitted from web browsers do not apply to our site, and we do not alter any of our data collection and use practices upon receipt of such a signal.</p>

  <p><strong>Third-Party</strong></p>

    <p>Some of the Services may contain links to third-party content that is neither maintained nor controlled by Scoutahead. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of such third-parties, and we recommend that you consult their privacy policies for more information.</p>

    <p>We may allow third parties to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and/or similar technologies to collect information automatically through the Services. No such placement will be permitted without the</p>

  <p><strong>Business Transfers and Corporate Changes</strong></p>

    <p>If we are involved in a substantial corporate transaction, such as merger, consolidation, restructuring, or sale of our assets, sale of our Services, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy or insolvency, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>

  <p><strong>How Can I Contact Scoutahead?</strong></p>

    <p>For Enterprise User Accounts, please contact us via your Organization's account manager.</p>

  <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>

    <p>We ask that you read this Privacy Policy from time to time. Scoutahead may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We will revise the "effective date" above and post the new Privacy Policy.</p>
